# An ACE/TAO/OpenDDS Build Matrix for Android  [![matrix](https://github.com/iguessthislldo/OpenDDS-Android/workflows/matrix/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iguessthislldo/OpenDDS-Android/actions?query=workflow%3Amatrix)

Scripts for building [OpenDDS](https://github.com/objectcomputing/OpenDDS)
against various combinations of Android NDK and API versions on GitHub Actions.
Also can be used to build OpenDDS for Android locally on a Linux or macOS
machine.

### Modifying the Matrix

The matrix defines the combinations of Android NDK revisions, API levels, and
other information used for the builds. To change the matrix, edit the early
parts of `matrix.py` and run the script with Python 3. It will update
`.github/workflows/matrix.yml`, maybe `default.settings.sh`, and `README.md`
(this file).

## Running Locally

These instructions are for doing a single build. Doing multiple builds in a row
with the same workspace is possible, but will require figuring out what should
be kept and what should be cleaned up. There is no script here that will do
that for you unfortunately.

### Requirements

In addition to standard Unix tools and the normal requirements of OpenDDS on
Linux or macOS, the following programs are needed:

- CMake
- Python 3
- `md5sum`
- A Java Development Kit (If building with OpenDDS with Java)

If using Linux, all of these are probably already installed or can be installed
easily from the package manager. If using Homebrew on macOS, these can be
installed using:

```
brew install cmake python3 md5sha1sum openjdk
```

Note that if using Homebrew's OpenJDK, it will not put itself on the `$PATH`,
so you will have to do that yourself before running these scripts.

### Running

1. Copy `default.settings.sh` to `settings.sh` and modify it as you see fit.
   You can also set the environment variables in this file instead. See next
   section about that.
2. Run `run.sh`.

That's it, assuming nothing goes wrong.

## Environment Variables

There are several environment variables that are the normal settings for the
build. These all can be found in `default.settings.sh`. The first three: `ndk`,
`arch`, and `api` are required so set to some example values. The rest are
optional.

In addition to those, what ACE/TAO and OpenDDS it clones can optionally be
controlled using `ACE_TAO_REPO`, `ACE_TAO_BRANCH`, `OPENDDS_REPO`, and
`OPENDDS_BRANCH`.

## Legal

By running this you are implicitly agreeing to the licences for the Android SDK
and the Android NDK, as well as OpenDDS, ACE/TAO, as well as anything else.
