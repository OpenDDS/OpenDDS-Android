# An ACE/TAO/OpenDDS Build Matrix for Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iguessthislldo/OpenDDS-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iguessthislldo/OpenDDS-Android)

Scripts for building [OpenDDS](https://github.com/objectcomputing/OpenDDS)
against various combinations of Android NDK, API versions, and
CPUs, either on Travis-CI or in a regular Unix environment.

## Modifying the Matrix

To change the matrix, edit the `matrix` structure in `matrix.py` and run the
script with Python 3. It will update `shell_matrix.sh`, `.travis.yml` and this file.

# Running the Matrix

## One Case At a Time

To run the matrix one case at a time, run:

```sh
cp settings.sh default.settings.sh
```

And edit `settings.sh` to what kind of build you're looking for.

After that you can run:

```sh
bash get-ACE-TAO.sh
bash get-OpenDDS.sh
bash get-NDK.sh
```

Alternatively you can reuse ones already downloaded/built by using links and
the `host_tools` option in `settings.sh`.

To build the single case that's now set up, run:

```sh
bash single_round.sh
```

## All the Cases

To run all the cases in the matrix, just run:

```sh
bash shell_matrix.sh
```
