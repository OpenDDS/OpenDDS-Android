# An ACE/TAO/OpenDDS Build Matrix for Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iguessthislldo/OpenDDS-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iguessthislldo/OpenDDS-Android)

Scripts for building [OpenDDS](https://github.com/objectcomputing/OpenDDS)
against various combinations of Android NDK and API versions on Travis-CI.

### Modifying the Matrix

To change the matrix, edit `matrix.py` and run the script with Python 3. It
will update `.travis.yml` and `README.md` (this file).

## Running Locally

There used to be a shell version of the matrix but I never used it beyond
initial testing so eventually I removed it. These instructions are for doing a
single build. Also because these are bash scripts, there were designed for a
Unix system, particualrly a Linux system, but still might need some
modifcations to work on macOS.

1. Copy `default.settings.sh` to `settings.sh` and modify it as you see fit.
2. Run `run.sh`.

That's it, assuming nothing goes wrong.

What ACE/TAO and OpenDDS repos it clones can be controlled using
`ACE_TAO_REPO`, `ACE_TAO_BRANCH`, `OPENDDS_REPO`, and `OPENDDS_BRANCH`.
