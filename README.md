# An ACE/TAO/OpenDDS Build Matrix for Android  [![matrix](https://github.com/iguessthislldo/OpenDDS-Android/workflows/matrix/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iguessthislldo/OpenDDS-Android/actions?query=workflow%3Amatrix)

Scripts for building [OpenDDS](https://github.com/objectcomputing/OpenDDS)
against various combinations of Android NDK and API versions on GitHub Actions.

### Modifying the Matrix

To change the matrix, edit `matrix.py` and run the script with Python 3. It
will update `.github/workflows/matrix.yml` and `README.md` (this file).

## Running Locally

There used to be a shell version of the matrix but I never used it beyond
initial testing so eventually I removed it. These instructions are for doing a
single build. These are bash scripts developed on a Ubuntu Linux system. They
might need some modifications to work on other Linux systems or macOS.

1. Copy `default.settings.sh` to `settings.sh` and modify it as you see fit.
   You can also set the environment variables in this file instead. See next
   section about that.
2. Run `run.sh`.

That's it, assuming nothing goes wrong. Doing multiple builds in a row will
require some cleanup.

## Environment Variables

There are several environment variables that are the normal settings for the
build. These all can be found in `default.settings.sh`. The first three: `ndk`,
`arch`, and `api` are required so set to some example values. The rest are
optional.

In addition to those, what ACE/TAO and OpenDDS it clones can optionally be
controlled using `ACE_TAO_REPO`, `ACE_TAO_BRANCH`, `OPENDDS_REPO`, and
`OPENDDS_BRANCH`.
